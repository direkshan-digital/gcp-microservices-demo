# Smart Inventory Demand Forecasting Agent

An autonomous AI agent that continuously monitors shopping patterns, seasonal trends, external factors, and real-time sales data to predict demand and automatically optimize inventory levels.

## Features

- **Autonomous Decision Making**: Makes real-time inventory decisions without human intervention
- **Multi-Source Intelligence**: Combines internal sales data with external signals (weather, social trends, economic indicators)
- **Adaptive Learning**: Learns from prediction accuracy and adjusts models continuously
- **Explainable AI**: Provides reasoning for inventory decisions
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously analyzes shopping patterns and external factors

## Architecture

The agent consists of several AI components working together:

1. **Pattern Recognition Engine**: Analyzes historical sales data and identifies trends
2. **External Signal Processor**: Monitors weather, social media trends, and economic indicators
3. **Demand Forecasting Model**: Predicts future demand using multiple data sources
4. **Inventory Optimizer**: Recommends optimal stock levels and reorder points
5. **Learning Feedback Loop**: Continuously improves predictions based on actual outcomes
